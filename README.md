# QBasic
Collection of short programs I made around 2002 when learning how to code.

# Watch compilation
Watch compilation of these programs at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqi3HG2KGFs.

# How to run
In order to try some apps straight away, place any zip file from run/ folder to https://virtualconsoles.com/online-emulators/dos/ and type name of that zip file in it (without extension).

Place QuickBasic 4.5 qb.exe file into root and run it in MS-DOS or emulator like DOSBox. Click on file -> open to load any script.
