# QBasic
Collection of short programs I made around 2002 when learning how to code.

# Watch compilation
Watch compilation of these programs at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqi3HG2KGFs.

# How to run
In order to try some apps straight away, place any zip file from run/ folder to https://virtualconsoles.com/online-emulators/dos/ and type name of that zip file in it (without extension).

Place QuickBasic 4.5 qb.exe file into root and run it in MS-DOS or emulator like DOSBox. Click on file -> open to load any script.

# Info
***RUN***
- Try to run *RUN* game with input 200 when prompted. Inputting higher number will decrease the speed and vice versa.
- There are weapons hidden in randomly placed yellow pixels that can be activated by space or end, depending on the player.
- Walls at the edges of the screen are electric, but they might not kill you as the damage is random. You can actually end up
  behind the screen which is especially useful when evading computer controlled player.
